upgrade:
  - When migrating from Liberty to Mitaka neutron does not automatically
    set or migrate networks MTU settings. Neutron has no migration to
    correctly set the MTU on existing networks so we've created an OSA
    MTU migration playbook to work-around this issue. The playbook will
    set the MTU on networks created before the upgrade by iterating on
    known values from the user_variables and facts. Should any known
    network name be encountered the MTU will be set to the known value.
    If no MTU and no global override is present the playbook will
    fall back to using 1500 for vlan/flat networks and 1450 for vxlan
    networks.
